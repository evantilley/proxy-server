We like to think our privacy policy is pretty simple. We don't collect any data, period. We do monitor overall app usage metadata statistics (such as total online active users, accounts created, etc.), but we don't save this data and/or analyze it. We simply check in from time to time to gain a sense of how our app is resonating with users and also ensure our security is up-to-date. One important thing to note: We use Firebase, a service provided by Google, to help store data on our back end. You can check out their privacy policy <a href = "https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">here</a>. Our privacy policy is subject to change and we will let users know if this does happen.
